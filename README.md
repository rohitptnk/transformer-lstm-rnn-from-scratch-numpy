# Deep Learning from Scratch with NumPy

This repository contains **from-scratch implementations** of core deep learning sequence models: **RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers**, built using only **NumPy** (no deep learning frameworks).

The goal of this project is to:
* Understand the internal mechanics of sequence models.
* Recreate training loops, backpropagation, and optimization without black-box libraries.
* Demonstrate strong fundamentals in machine learning and neural networks.

Implemented models:
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Transformer (Encoder/Decoder, Attention mechanisms)
